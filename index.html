            <h3>Mobile App Development</h3>
            <p>
              I have made a lot of mobile applications specifically for the
              Swift programming language for the iOS platform. In addition to
              this, while I am familiar with the JavaScript library React, I
              have also made React Native apps suitable for all platforms.

            <h3>Teatime Research</h3>
            <p>
              I was on an internship at a company called Teatime Research. My
              jobs were very varied. For example, I made introductory videos for
              clients showing how to use the software and what features it has.
              I taught them how to deploy VR hardware and AR software.

            <p>
              Nitomani School Oy was a Finnish family company founded in 2017,
              which focuses on teaching game programming online. In the fall of
              2017, we participated in a business accelerator program where we
              received training and mentoring from professionals in the field.
              xEdu is Nordic's no. 1 business accelerator for startups creating
              transformative learning solutions with pedagogical impact. The
              goal of the program was to accelerate the participant's business

              mentoring, real-life testing environments for research and
              development, and help with internationalization.
